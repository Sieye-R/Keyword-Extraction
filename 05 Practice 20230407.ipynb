When I cook, I am often reminded of my ex-housemates who conducted their own experiments and also joined mine. Ironically, dining in our places provided us with more chances to try exquisite and rare food than when dining out. This is because we inspired each other by cooking together and it created synergies. \n",

Therefore, I invite my friends and acquaintances once in a while in order to obtain their feedback on my own cuisine.

However, I often find it tricky to satisfy children as many of them are fussy eaters. \n",
